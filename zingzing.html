<p> The sky is an ocean being kept from us by a dome. Our gods are William Smith and the cast of Fish Hooks. When we die we turn into customizable fish that go into the sky ocean. Good fish go into the clean, daytime sky ocean. Bad fish go into the polluted, nighttime sky ocean. For more information come to our meeting on Tuesday from 1am to 4am at the midpoint between Jerusalem and Israeli territories. Please consider joining the Zing Zingees!</p>

<h3 class="pretty"> Meeting Info: </h3>
<p> Where: The midpoint between Jerusalem and Israel territories <br>
When: Tuesdays 1am-4am <br>
What we do: We watch Sharktales on repeat while eating swedish fish. At 3:27 we make a circle around the room with the TVs turned to Fishhooks and Sharktales on full volume, we then lay on the ground in the shape of a triangle and flop around like fish out of water. We then transcend and disintegrate into the air. </p>
