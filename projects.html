<p style="padding:0px 20px"> About: In this python program I coded a few months ago, you can see how well you know your best friend Kelli! Once you're done it will show you your score, and will let you see the correct answers to all the questions.</p> <p style="padding: 0px 20px"> Notes: Inputs are not case sensitive. Once you stop the code all of your data is gone.  </p>

<h2 class="pretty"> Are u Cool?: </h2>
<h3 class="pretty"> Link: <a href="https://repl.it/@KawaiiOuran/Are-u-Cool"> https://repl.it/@KawaiiOuran/Are-u-Cool </a> </h3>
<p style ="padding:0px 20px"> About: I made this python code during the summer as a funny pass time. Test how cool you are with either the game or the quiz. The game asks you yes or no questions to test your coolness, while the quiz puts you in scenarios and gives you decisions to choose from. When you are done with either it gives you your score.</p>
<p style= "padding:0px 20px"> Notes:  You may either make a person before playing, OR you can use the dummy person already made named 'kelli'. Names are not case sensitive. Every time the code stops it loses all of your data. </p>

<p style="padding: 0px 20px"> About: This was an on and off project of mine for a few months and I finally finished it in July! It's probably my biggest project yet. In this 2D frog sim you get to make your own frog and eat, fight, mate, and have offspring! I also used SQLite for the first time in this project, so you can save your frog for next time! You can play it on Repl.it but feel free to download the code and files from GitHub to run on an IDE for a better experience! </p>
<p style="padding: 0px 20px"> Notes: The game looks a little different in repl.it than it does in an IDE. The game does not save your data automatically you must click the save button on the main menu before stopping the code. </p>
