<p style="padding:0px 20px"> About: In this python program I coded a few months ago, you can see how well you know your best friend Kelli! Once you're done it will show you your score, and will let you see the correct answers to all the questions.</p> <p style="padding: 0px 20px"> Notes: Inputs are not case sensitive. Once you stop the code all of your data is gone.  </p>

<h2 class="pretty"> Are u Cool?: </h2>
<h3 class="pretty"> Link: <a href="https://repl.it/@KawaiiOuran/Are-u-Cool"> https://repl.it/@KawaiiOuran/Are-u-Cool </a> </h3>
<p style ="padding:0px 20px"> About: I made this python code during the summer as a funny pass time. Test how cool you are with either the game or the quiz. The game asks you yes or no questions to test your coolness, while the quiz puts you in scenarios and gives you decisions to choose from. When you are done with either it gives you your score.</p>
<p style= "padding:0px 20px"> Notes:  You may either make a person before playing, OR you can use the dummy person already made named 'kelli'. Names are not case sensitive. Every time the code stops it loses all of your data. </p>
