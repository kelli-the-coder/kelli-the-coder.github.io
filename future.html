<h3 class="pretty" > High School: </h3>
<p> I am currently a sophomore taking a Culinary class, German, Algebra 2, Chemistry, US history, and a swim class. Next year I will take an AP CS course where I will learn Java. I will also take pre-calc, physics, and German again. I am also thinking of taking a new Cybersecurity class they offer at my school during senior year.</p>
<h3 class="pretty" > After High School: </h3>
<p> After High School I would like to go to university and major in Computer Science. The college I am currenly hoping to attend is U of I. I am hoping to get a job where I can program software or applications for computers or code for video games. </p>
